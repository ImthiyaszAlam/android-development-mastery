## **📌 41. What is Dependency Injection, and how does Hilt help in Android?**  
✅ **Answer:**  
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that helps manage dependencies in a more modular and testable way. **Hilt** is the recommended DI framework for Android.  

### **Key Benefits of Hilt:**  
✔ Reduces boilerplate code  
✔ Provides better lifecycle-aware dependency management  
✔ Simplifies dependency injection setup  

📝 **Example (Hilt in ViewModel):**  
```kotlin
@HiltViewModel
class MyViewModel @Inject constructor(private val repository: MyRepository) : ViewModel() {
    fun getData() = repository.fetchData()
}
```
👉 **Tip:** Use `@Singleton` to ensure a single instance of a dependency.

## **📌 42. What is the difference between LiveData and StateFlow?**  
✅ **Answer:**  
| Feature | LiveData | StateFlow |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Lifecycle-aware | Yes | No |
| Hot/Cold Stream | Cold | Hot |
| Initial Value Required | No | Yes |
| Observer Needed | Yes | No |

📝 **Example (Using StateFlow in ViewModel):**  
```kotlin
class MyViewModel : ViewModel() {
    private val _state = MutableStateFlow("Initial Data")
    val state: StateFlow<String> = _state
}
```
👉 **Tip:** Use **LiveData** when working with UI components and **StateFlow** for data processing.

## **📌 43. What is the Paging Library in Android?**  
✅ **Answer:**  
The Paging Library efficiently loads and displays large datasets in RecyclerViews, improving performance.  

### **Benefits:**  
✔ Supports **infinite scrolling**  
✔ Works well with **Room and Retrofit**  
✔ Supports **coroutines and Flow**  

📝 **Example (Using Paging in Repository):**  
```kotlin
val pager = Pager(
    PagingConfig(pageSize = 20)
) {
    MyPagingSource()
}.flow
```
👉 **Tip:** Use `RemoteMediator` to load data from both local DB and API.

---

## **📌 44. What is the Navigation Component in Jetpack?**  
✅ **Answer:**  
Navigation Component simplifies **fragment navigation** and **deep linking** in Android.  

📝 **Example (Using Navigation in XML):**  
```xml
<fragment
    android:id="@+id/homeFragment"
    android:name="com.example.HomeFragment">
    <action
        android:id="@+id/action_home_to_detail"
        app:destination="@id/detailFragment"/>
</fragment>
```
👉 **Tip:** Use **Safe Args** to pass data safely between fragments.

## **📌 45. What is ViewBinding, and how is it different from DataBinding?**  
✅ **Answer:**  
ViewBinding and DataBinding both remove the need for `findViewById()`.  

| Feature | ViewBinding | DataBinding |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Generates Binding Classes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Supports Observables | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Requires `layout` Tag | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Handles UI Updates | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

📝 **Example (Using ViewBinding in Activity):**  
```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private lateinit var binding: ActivityMainBinding
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        binding = ActivityMainBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
        setContentView(binding.root)
        binding.textView.text = "Hello ViewBinding"
    }
}
```
👉 **Tip:** Use **ViewBinding** for simple views and **DataBinding** for complex UI interactions.

## **📌 46. How do you optimize an Android app for performance?**  
✅ **Answer:**  
✔ **Reduce Memory Usage:** Use RecyclerView, avoid memory leaks with WeakReference.  
✔ **Optimize Network Calls:** Use Retrofit with OkHttp caching.  
✔ **Improve Rendering Performance:** Use ConstraintLayout, avoid overdraw.  
✔ **Background Work Optimization:** Use WorkManager, Coroutines, and Jetpack libraries.  

👉 **Tip:** Use `Android Studio Profiler` to analyze CPU, memory, and network usage.

## **📌 47. What is the difference between Room and SQLite?**  
✅ **Answer:**  
| Feature | Room | SQLite |
|---------|------|--------|
| Type Safety | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Uses Annotations | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Boilerplate Code | ❌ Less | ✅ More |
| Supports LiveData/Flow | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |

📝 **Example (Room Entity & DAO):**  
```kotlin
@Entity
data class User(@PrimaryKey val id: Int, val name: String)

@Dao
interface UserDao {
    @Query("SELECT * FROM user")
    fun getAllUsers(): Flow<List<User>>
}
```
👉 **Tip:** Use `suspend functions` in DAO for better async execution.

---

## **📌 48. What is ProGuard, and why is it used?**  
✅ **Answer:**  
ProGuard is a tool that **shrinks, optimizes, and obfuscates** Android apps.  

### **Benefits:**  
✔ Reduces APK size  
✔ Improves security by obfuscating code  
✔ Removes unused classes and methods  

📝 **Enable ProGuard in `gradle.properties`:**  
```gradle
android.enableR8=true
```
👉 **Tip:** Use **R8 (default in Android Studio)** instead of ProGuard for better optimization.

---

## **📌 49. What are Content Providers, and when should you use them?**  
✅ **Answer:**  
Content Providers **share data between apps** securely using a URI-based system.  

### **Use Cases:**  
✔ Sharing contacts, media, calendar events  
✔ Accessing SQLite databases across apps  
✔ Fetching content via `ContentResolver`  

📝 **Example (Reading Contacts via ContentResolver):**  
```kotlin
val cursor = contentResolver.query(ContactsContract.Contacts.CONTENT_URI, null, null, null, null)
```
👉 **Tip:** Use **CursorLoader** for background queries.

---

## **📌 50. How do you handle large images efficiently in Android?**  
✅ **Answer:**  
✔ Use `BitmapFactory.Options.inSampleSize` to load scaled-down images  
✔ Use **Glide or Picasso** for efficient image loading  
✔ Use **LruCache** for in-memory caching  

📝 **Example (Using Glide to Load an Image Efficiently):**  
```kotlin
Glide.with(context)
    .load("https://example.com/image.jpg")
    .into(imageView)
```
👉 **Tip:** Use `coil` if you prefer Jetpack Compose-based image loading.
