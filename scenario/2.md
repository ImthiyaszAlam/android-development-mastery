## üî• 10 Scenario-Based Android Interview Questions

### 1. **App crashes only on some devices but not others. How do you debug?**

* Check logs with **Logcat / Crashlytics**.
* Compare **Android OS versions, device manufacturers** (OEM customizations).
* Check **proguard/R8 minification** issues.
* Reproduce with same device/emulator if possible.
* Add **defensive coding** (null checks, fallback).

---

### 2. **User complains app is draining battery. What will you do?**

* Check for **background services / WorkManager** misconfigurations.
* Use **Battery Historian / Android Profiler** to detect leaks.
* Optimize location updates, reduce polling intervals.
* Use **JobScheduler/WorkManager** with proper constraints.

---

### 3. **API is very slow. How do you make the app feel responsive?**

* Show **loading skeletons / shimmer** instead of blank screens.
* Use **cached data** (Room/SharedPreferences).
* Add **timeout + retry mechanism**.
* Move heavy parsing to background with **Coroutines/Dispatchers.IO**.

---

### 4. **User reports app is showing stale data offline. How to fix?**

* Add **timestamps** with cached data.
* On app open, **check freshness** ‚Üí update if expired.
* Use **WorkManager periodic sync** in background.
* Notify user: *‚ÄúData last updated X mins ago‚Äù*.

---

### 5. **You see ANRs in Play Console. What‚Äôs your approach?**

* Check **ANR traces** (main thread blocked).
* Move heavy tasks (DB, network, image decoding) off main thread.
* Use **Coroutines with Dispatchers.IO / Default**.
* Optimize RecyclerView binds & adapters.

---

### 6. **How do you handle secure storage of tokens or API keys?**

* Store **short-term session tokens** in **EncryptedSharedPreferences**.
* Use **Keystore** for cryptographic keys.
* Never hardcode API keys ‚Üí use backend token exchange.
* Add **https/TLS** and certificate pinning.

---

### 7. **A feature needs background sync, but user should not see app lag. How do you do it?**

* Use **WorkManager** with constraints (Wi-Fi, charging).
* Sync in **background coroutine**.
* Provide **status updates / notifications** only if needed.

---

### 8. **Image-heavy feed is loading very slow. How do you optimize?**

* Use **image loading libs** (Glide, Coil) with caching.
* Resize images before loading (avoid full-res).
* Enable **lazy loading / pagination**.
* Use placeholders (shimmer, default image).

---

### 9. **How would you handle multiple API calls where one depends on the other?**

* Use **Coroutines** with `suspend` functions.
* Chain calls using `coroutineScope` or `flatMapConcat` with Flow.
* Example: First call login ‚Üí get token ‚Üí second call fetch data.
* Handle failure gracefully with retry/backoff.

---

### 10. **App suddenly starts crashing after Play Store release. What steps will you take?**

* Check **Firebase Crashlytics / Play Console Vitals**.
* Rollback if major crash.
* Use **feature flags** to disable buggy features.
* Hotfix via patch release.
* Add missing test cases to prevent repeat.
