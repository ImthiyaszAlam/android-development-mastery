# ⚡ Performance-Related Android Interview Q\&A

### 1. **How do you avoid memory leaks in Android?**

* Don’t keep long-lived references to `Context` or `Activity` in static fields.
* Use **WeakReference** for listeners.
* Avoid anonymous inner classes holding implicit references.
* Use **ViewBinding** instead of `findViewById`.
* Monitor with **LeakCanary**.

💬 *Oral answer:*

> “I avoid leaks by releasing references in `onDestroy()`, using WeakReferences where needed, and profiling with LeakCanary regularly.”

### 2. **How do you improve RecyclerView performance?**

* Use `setHasFixedSize(true)` if list size doesn’t change.
* Enable **DiffUtil** for partial updates.
* Use **ViewHolder pattern** correctly.
* Reuse layouts, avoid deep nesting.
* Use `ListAdapter` instead of manual notify methods.

💬 *Oral answer:*

> “I optimize RecyclerView with DiffUtil, caching images, avoiding nested layouts, and enabling fixed size whenever possible.”

---

### 3. **How do you reduce app startup time?**

* Minimize heavy work in `Application.onCreate()`.
* Use **lazy initialization** for SDKs.
* Move work to background threads (WorkManager, Coroutines).
* Use **App Startup Library** for deferred initialization.

💬 *Oral answer:*

> “I profile cold vs warm starts, move initialization off the main thread, and defer SDK setup until actually required.”

---

### 4. **How do you optimize network calls?**

* Use **Retrofit with OkHttp caching**.
* Enable **gzip compression**.
* Batch requests when possible.
* Use **pagination** instead of bulk fetch.
* Add **timeout + retry** with exponential backoff.

💬 *Oral answer:*

> “I minimize payloads, enable caching, and use pagination to ensure smoother user experience on slower networks.”

---

### 5. **How do you handle large image loading without lag?**

* Use **Glide/Coil/Picasso** with caching.
* Downsample images before loading.
* Use placeholders & lazy loading.
* Decode bitmaps in background (`Dispatchers.IO`).

💬 *Oral answer:*

> “I always resize images before rendering, use Glide with memory/disk cache, and offload decoding to background threads.”

---

### 6. **How do you avoid ANRs (Application Not Responding)?**

* Keep **main thread free** of heavy tasks.
* Offload DB, network, and image operations to **coroutines/threads**.
* Use **timeout mechanisms**.
* Profile with **StrictMode** to detect blocking calls.

💬 *Oral answer:*

> “I strictly keep long tasks off the main thread using Coroutines, and monitor with StrictMode to ensure no UI blocking.”

---

### 7. **How do you reduce APK/Bundle size?**

* Use **R8/ProGuard** for code shrinking & obfuscation.
* Enable **resource shrinking** in Gradle.
* Use **WebP/AVIF** instead of PNG/JPEG.
* Split APKs with **App Bundle & ABI splits**.

💬 *Oral answer:*

> “I reduce size with R8, resource shrinking, and App Bundles, plus I prefer modern formats like WebP to cut image size.”

---

### 8. **How do you improve scrolling performance in a feed?**

* Use **RecyclerView optimizations** (fixed size, view cache).
* Prefetch data/images ahead of scroll.
* Avoid expensive bindings in `onBindViewHolder`.
* Use placeholders to prevent UI jumps.

💬 *Oral answer:*

> “I profile slow binds, use DiffUtil, and prefetch images so the scrolling feels buttery smooth.”

---

### 9. **How do you monitor and optimize app performance in production?**

* Use **Firebase Performance Monitoring**.
* Monitor **frame drops (FPS), network latency, memory leaks**.
* Profile regularly with Android Profiler (CPU, memory, network).
* Add **custom logs & analytics** for slow paths.

💬 *Oral answer:*

> “I integrate Firebase Performance, monitor ANRs & crashes in Play Console, and profile memory/CPU usage regularly.”

---

### 10. **How do you optimize database (Room/SQLite) performance?**

* Use **suspend functions** with Coroutines (async queries).
* Add **indexes** for frequently searched columns.
* Use **Flow** for reactive queries instead of constant polling.
* Batch inserts/updates instead of one by one.

💬 *Oral answer:*

> “I optimize DB with proper indexing, async queries on IO dispatcher, and batching writes instead of individual inserts.”
