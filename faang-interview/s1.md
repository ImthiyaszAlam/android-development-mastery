## 🧠 Interview Q&A: MVVM Architecture in Android

### 📌 Question:
**Can you explain MVVM architecture and how you implemented it in your projects?**

---

### 💡 How to Answer:
- Define **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** and explain its components.
- Discuss how you used **ViewModel, LiveData, Repository, and Data Sources**.
- Mention a project (e.g., **MELA App** or **UPAVP-PEMS**) where you implemented MVVM.
- Highlight how it improved **scalability and maintainability**.

---

### ✅ Ideal Answer:

> “MVVM stands for Model-View-ViewModel, and it’s an architecture that helps separate concerns in Android development.  
>
> The Model handles the business logic and data sources like APIs or local databases.  
>
> The ViewModel acts as a bridge between the Model and the View. It holds UI-related data using LiveData or StateFlow and survives configuration changes.  
>
> The View observes the ViewModel for changes and updates the UI accordingly.  
>
> In my MELA App project, I implemented MVVM to ensure scalability and clean separation of concerns.  
>
> The Model layer included a Repository class that fetched data from Retrofit APIs and a local Room database.  
>
> The ViewModel exposed this data via LiveData, and the View (Activity/Fragment or Jetpack Compose UI) observed it to update UI reactively.  
>
> I used Hilt for dependency injection to inject the Repository into the ViewModel.  
>
> This helped me keep the code clean, testable, and modular. For example, when I needed to implement caching with Paging 3, I only had to update the Repository without touching the View or ViewModel logic.”

### 🔍 Bonus Tip (if interviewer asks follow-up):

- **If asked about lifecycle handling:**

> “Using ViewModel means I don’t have to worry about losing data on screen rotation since ViewModels survive configuration changes.”

- **If asked about why MVVM over MVC/MVP:**

> “MVVM is more suited for modern Android architecture. With Jetpack libraries like ViewModel, LiveData, and Data Binding or Compose, it naturally supports a reactive UI and testability.”



## 🧠 Interview Q&A: How did you handle Dependency Injection in your Android projects?

### 📌 Question:
**How did you handle Dependency Injection in your Android projects?**

---

### 💡 How to Answer:
- Define **Dependency Injection (DI)** and why it’s important.
- Mention the use of **Hilt** for DI in your projects.
- Explain how you injected **ViewModels, Repositories, Retrofit, Room**, etc.
- Highlight benefits like **testability**, **clean architecture**, and **scalability**.

---

### ✅ Ideal Answer:

> “Dependency Injection is a design pattern used to reduce coupling in code by providing dependencies from outside rather than creating them internally.  
>
> In Android, I used **Hilt**, which is built on top of Dagger and provides a simpler way to manage DI with less boilerplate.  
>
> In my **MELA App project**, I used Hilt to inject the **Repository** into the **ViewModel**, and injected Retrofit, Room, and Firebase instances at the application level.  
>
> For example, I created a `NetworkModule` that provided a Retrofit instance, and a `DatabaseModule` for the Room database. I annotated these with `@Module` and `@Provides`, and scoped them using `@Singleton`.  
>
> This approach made the app **scalable and easier to test**. I could mock dependencies in unit tests without touching implementation classes.  
>
> Also, Hilt helped me maintain clean architecture by ensuring each layer (ViewModel, UseCases, Repository) had only the dependencies it required.”

### 🔍 Bonus Tip (if interviewer asks follow-up):

- **If asked why Hilt over manual DI or Dagger:**

> “Hilt reduces boilerplate, integrates seamlessly with Jetpack libraries like ViewModel and WorkManager, and requires less setup than plain Dagger.”

- **If asked about lifecycle scope or memory:**

> “Using `@ActivityRetainedScoped` or `@Singleton` allows me to control the lifetime of dependencies efficiently without memory leaks.”
