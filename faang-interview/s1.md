1. Can you explain MVVM architecture and how you implemented it in your projects?
How to Answer:

Define MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) and explain its components.

Discuss how you used ViewModel, LiveData, Repository, and Data Sources.

Mention a project (e.g., MELA App or UPAVP-PEMS) where you implemented MVVM.

Highlight how it improved scalability and maintainability.

‚úÖ Ideal Answer:
‚ÄúMVVM stands for Model-View-ViewModel, and it‚Äôs an architecture that helps separate concerns in Android development.

The Model handles the business logic and data sources like APIs or local databases.

The ViewModel acts as a bridge between the Model and the View. It holds UI-related data using LiveData or StateFlow and survives configuration changes.

The View observes the ViewModel for changes and updates the UI accordingly.

In my MELA App project, I implemented MVVM to ensure scalability and clean separation of concerns.

The Model layer included a Repository class that fetched data from Retrofit APIs and a local Room database.

The ViewModel exposed this data via LiveData, and the View (Activity/Fragment or Jetpack Compose UI) observed it to update UI reactively.

I used Hilt for dependency injection to inject the Repository into the ViewModel.

This helped me keep the code clean, testable, and modular. For example, when I needed to implement caching with Paging 3, I only had to update the Repository without touching the View or ViewModel logic.‚Äù

üîç Bonus Tip (if interviewer asks follow-up):
If asked about lifecycle handling:

‚ÄúUsing ViewModel means I don‚Äôt have to worry about losing data on screen rotation since ViewModels survive configuration changes.‚Äù

If asked about why MVVM over MVC/MVP:

‚ÄúMVVM is more suited for modern Android architecture. With Jetpack libraries like ViewModel, LiveData, and Data Binding or Compose, it naturally supports a reactive UI and testability.‚Äù
