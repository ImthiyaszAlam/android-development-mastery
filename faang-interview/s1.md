## 🧠 Interview Q&A: MVVM Architecture in Android

### 📌 Question:
**Can you explain MVVM architecture and how you implemented it in your projects?**

---

### 💡 How to Answer:
- Define **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** and explain its components.
- Discuss how you used **ViewModel, LiveData, Repository, and Data Sources**.
- Mention a project (e.g., **MELA App** or **UPAVP-PEMS**) where you implemented MVVM.
- Highlight how it improved **scalability and maintainability**.

### ✅ Ideal Answer:

> “MVVM stands for Model-View-ViewModel, and it’s an architecture that helps separate concerns in Android development.  
>
> The Model handles the business logic and data sources like APIs or local databases.  
>
> The ViewModel acts as a bridge between the Model and the View. It holds UI-related data using LiveData or StateFlow and survives configuration changes.  
>
> The View observes the ViewModel for changes and updates the UI accordingly.  
>
> In my MELA App project, I implemented MVVM to ensure scalability and clean separation of concerns.  
>
> The Model layer included a Repository class that fetched data from Retrofit APIs and a local Room database.  
>
> The ViewModel exposed this data via LiveData, and the View (Activity/Fragment or Jetpack Compose UI) observed it to update UI reactively.  
>
> I used Hilt for dependency injection to inject the Repository into the ViewModel.  
>
> This helped me keep the code clean, testable, and modular. For example, when I needed to implement caching with Paging 3, I only had to update the Repository without touching the View or ViewModel logic.”

### 🔍 Bonus Tip (if interviewer asks follow-up):

- **If asked about lifecycle handling:**

> “Using ViewModel means I don’t have to worry about losing data on screen rotation since ViewModels survive configuration changes.”

- **If asked about why MVVM over MVC/MVP:**

> “MVVM is more suited for modern Android architecture. With Jetpack libraries like ViewModel, LiveData, and Data Binding or Compose, it naturally supports a reactive UI and testability.”
